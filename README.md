This app is just for learning and portfolio purposes. I'm using to learn and evolve my Flutter capacities.

## Getting Started

As it is only for portfolio and I used the test mode in Firebase, a normal user can't add, delete or edit the products. But can use the other funcionalities, like adding items to cart, placing orders, adding items to favorite and many more!
